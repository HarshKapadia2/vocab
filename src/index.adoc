== Abstract

This web site contains some English vocabulary for https://www.ets.org/gre/[GRE].

== Preface

A good English vocabulary is immensely important for the GRE examination. Learning and keeping track of words is difficult, so the author, https://www.linkedin.com/in/harshgkapadia/[Harsh Kapadia], is using this web site as a track of the words that he is learning.

This web site is a work in progress and is constantly updated! The web site source code can be found on https://github.com/HarshKapadia2/vocab[GitHub]. Do not hesitate to raise an https://github.com/HarshKapadia2/vocab/issues[issue] if there is any mistake/typo in the web site. Inputs and suggestions are appreciated and most welcome!
